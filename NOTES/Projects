I am a System Operations Engineer responsible for handling system breakdowns, attending urgent incidents, and participating in scheduled maintenance and meetings. I want to build a Python-based application that improves my operational workflow, incident tracking, and task management.

The system should integrate with Google Calendar to automatically create reminders and trigger alarms for upcoming meetings, maintenance windows, and critical tasks.

Additionally, I need a centralized platform to log and track technical incidents such as system breakdowns. Each breakdown record should include:

Duration of downtime

Error name / code

Affected component

Root cause

Actions taken

Resolution status (Solved / Escalated to L2 support)

Date of occurrence

Case Reference

The application should allow me to quickly search past incidents to determine whether a similar issue has occurred before and reference the solution.

I also want a module to manage warranty claims with the following details:

Serial Number (S/N)

Part Number

Part Name

Installation Date

Arrival Date

Case Reference

Furthermore, the system must be flexible enough to support custom record types for new operational scenarios. For example, creating an "Oil Leak Record" that captures:

Robot Number

Wheel Position

Date of Occurrence

The application should be scalable so I can add new record categories without redesigning the entire system.

Please recommend a Python project architecture, technology stack, database design, and key features that would make this application reliable, scalable, and suitable for real-world operational use.
